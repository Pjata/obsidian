A good estimate is an estimate that provides a clear enough view of the project  
reality to allow the project leadership to make good decisions about how to  
control the project to hit its targets.

In my discussions with executives, I’ve frequently asked, “What is more important to  
you: the ability to change your mind about features, or the ability to know cost, sched-  
ule, and functionality in advance?” At least 8 times out of 10, executives respond “The  
ability to know cost, schedule, and functionality in advance”—in other words, predict-  
ability. Other software experts have made the same observation (Moseman 2002,  
Putnam and Myers 2003).

One question that managers and customers ask is, “If I give you another week to  
work on your estimate, can you refine it so that it contains less uncertainty?” That’s  
a reasonable request, but unfortunately it’s not possible to deliver on that request.  
Research by Luiz Laranjeira suggests that the accuracy of the software estimate  
depends on the level of refinement of the software’s definition (Laranjeira 1990).  
The more refined the definition, the more accurate the estimate.


Don’t assume that the Cone of Uncertainty will narrow itself. You must force the  
Cone to narrow by removing sources of variability from your project.


Software organizations routinely sabotage their own projects by making commit-  
ments too early in the Cone of Uncertainty. If you commit at Initial Concept or Prod-  
uct Definition time, you will have a factor of 2x to 4x error in your estimates. As  
discussed in Chapter 1, “What Is an ‘Estimate’?”, a skilled project manager can navi-  
gate a project to completion if the estimate is within about 20% of the project reality.  
But no manager can navigate a project to a successful conclusion when the estimates  
are off by several hundred percent.  
Meaningful commitments are not possible in the early, wide part of the Cone. Effec-  
tive organizations delay their commitments until they have done the work to force  
the Cone to narrow. Meaningful commitments in the early-middle part of the project  
(about 30% of the way in) are possible and appropriate.
