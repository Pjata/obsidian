In my discussions with executives, I’ve frequently asked, “What is more important to  
you: the ability to change your mind about features, or the ability to know cost, sched-  
ule, and functionality in advance?” At least 8 times out of 10, executives respond “The  
ability to know cost, schedule, and functionality in advance”—in other words, predict-  
ability. Other software experts have made the same observation (Moseman 2002,  
Putnam and Myers 2003).
