I'd like to request some feedback for the Heap showcase.How understandable was it?  

To me it was very understandable, I could follow the flow on information easily. The lucidspark hepled a lot.

Did the amount of information feel sufficient? 
I think it was the right amount, had a clear structure.

Are you confident enough to start using Heap when needed, provided you get help when stuck?
Pretty much, but probably needs a little doc / examples how it was used before.

Overall the presentation was good, just long enough and cohesive. 
Maybe you could share some additional info in the eng channel / create a how to doc in markdown?
