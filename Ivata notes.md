“And so, in essence, a company can aspire to be a group focused on the things that it does best, but in order for people to work together it’s imperative to figure out the bare minimum of operating tasks that need to be completed, regardless of how taxing or unpleasant they may be. In that respect, I think it’s up to the management to ensure that this bare minimum is as small as possible.

“Being human means having potential. I see the role of the organization as making sure that everybody’s latent potential is fostered as effectively as possible. The organization will squander its resources if energy is wasted on irrelevant tasks, but if you can direct that energy to the right place, you can exert incredible influence on the outside world.”

“To reiterate, I firmly believe in the importance of setting goals, even when the goals are without precedent. If you simply keep piling on features, one after the next, things get crowded and the end result is bulky. But if you have a clear vision for what you want, you can say “Let’s do it this way” and work your way backward from there. Granted, a president can’t just say “Let’s do it this way” once and expect everybody to share their vision. People need to hear the same thing over and over, but before long, something that you’ve said will stick. They’ll realize, “Oh, that’s what they mean.” One person will get the gist, and then two more, and so on, until everybody realizes: “Nintendo set this as a goal. That’s why we’re here.” That way everyone can share the same vision for the foreseeable future. Of course, this may mean sounding like a broken record for a while.”

“Conversely, when both parties communicate effectively, it’s safe to assume that one party has made a skillful compromise, allowing them to understand and sympathize with the other person”

“ Unless they have the self-confidence to announce, “I’m the best,” engineers and artists never make any headway. Most programmers, too, believe their way of doing things to be superior. When these kinds of people join forces on a project, some conflict is unavoidable. Creativity, after all, is an expression of the ego.”

“When I’m really hooked on something, as long as I can figure out what got me hooked, I can take that process and apply it elsewhere as a way of drumming up interest.”
