Hi all, this week we had two sad news with both Peter and Kata leaving team Phoenix. 
Peter and Kata were crucial to make Phoenix truly a success story within Instructure. We can not be more thankful for them <3. (of course they are getting poached by others:) ).

They both leave some big shoes to fill. It wont be easy, but you all proved to be more professional and awesome than ever before. Personally, I will definitely need a lot of help.
Without you I definitely couldn't do this. So I trust you all to put even more attention to detail:)! I will get croissants for that!

This year we will grow together, sometimes fail together, learn together and do less manual deploys together!  
Kata put together a roadmap that makes our customers extremely happy, Peter taught us how to plan and deliver them.
