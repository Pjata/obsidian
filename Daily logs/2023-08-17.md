The problem: we are getting a lot of asks for "guestimations" from many sources. (examples: The one support project, NPS, Heap UUID, Canvas.NET login redirections).

There were occasions where the engineering team was notified for this before even the product.
These estimations also takes more time as often the specification is not good enough. 
Communication is often stressful as it indicates premature deadlines.





* we are being asked for estimations from many sources directly, not through our product
* these are somes asked as 'guesttimates' based on vague specifications, that results in more engineering time and inaccurate estimations


Solution:
Bigger company wide projects should come up in the quarterly planning.
