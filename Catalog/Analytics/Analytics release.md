May 2 is the release for prod

Discussed the release, here’s how we’re going to proceed:  

-   **We’re gonna keep the old analytics and the reports in production until June 30th**, so users can modify their automations if they have some, also to get used to the new analytics features
-   **We’re gonna communicate** that the old analytics and the reports will be removed from production after June 30th (with a **banner** on the related Catalog pages, in the release notes, in my blogpost, and CSMs will also send out emails)
-   **For new Catalog users we should hide the old versions**, so we won’t present them such thing which will be removed soon (feature flag is needed for this)
-   **In beta** we’re gonna **remove/hide the old versions**

Based on this, the action items are:  

-   I’m gonna create a ticket for the banner ([@Norbi](https://instructure.slack.com/team/U04172145DK) we’re gonna need a design for this, I’ll write the copy - cc [@tamas.laszlo](https://instructure.slack.com/team/U038ZMCSDJS) as soon as it’s ready you can pick this up)
-   I’m gonna create a ticket for the feature flag for new users
-   I assume a ticket is needed to remove the old version from beta, right? I’ll write up that one too.
