at the phoenix team we are dealing with lots of support weeks, one of the more common and time consuming ones are related to payment provider setups for Catalogs.

The problem can be seen here: we are not providing too much help on a prod environment to the implementation team.
To get to this error you also have to do some repetitive tasks, leading to huge feedback loops.

To help this problem i created a very small improvement:  a test payment flow.

it can be started without Catalog, and shows errors. For example, this error would have been a spport week. But now its an actionable error.
