Catalog enables schools to sell their courses and programs online.
Nowadays  storefronts offer multiple ways to have sales and promotions for their customers. Buy two, get one for 50%, black friday, autumn sales etc.

Sadly Catalog lacks behind, as it only offers promotions where you have to enter a specific code.

Our current workflows and implementations does not allow for simple extendable promotion improvements.
However for the past few months, our team has been in deep discussion how to simplify Catalog's data model and workflows.

With this hackweek, I wanted to showcase that with some good refactoring and clear data structures, we can enable simple future developments, like:
* Time based promotions (sales)
* User's email based promotions
* Buy X different items and get discounts

So this could really elevate how our users promote their stores.
