Catalog enables schools to sell their courses and programs online.
Nowadays  storefronts offer multiple ways to have sales and promotions for their customers. Buy two, get one for 50%, black friday, autumn sales etc.

Sadly Catalog lacks behind, as it only offers promotions where you have to enter a specific code.

Our current workflows does not allow simple implementations for features like these.

With this hackweek, I wanted to showcase that with some good refactoring and clear data structures, we can enable simple future developments, like:
* Time based promotions (sales)
* User's email based promotions
* Buy X, get discount promotions
